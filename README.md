**Eusociality** is defined by Wikipedia as the highest level of organization of sociality, is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative brood care, overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. 

**Summary of the Project:**
Philosophically speaking, Eusocial Cluster Utility was developed in direct opposition to cloud based computing.
A homemade super computer is the ultimate tool for developers working in machine learning, natural language processing, system simulations, or social media mining who do not wish to compromise the security of their data and risk computational throttling by the owner of a cloud web service. However the configuration of a local network cluster computer is not necessarily a simple task, nor is optimizing a cluster or ensuring that the safety of the hardware and integrity of the data. Eusocial Cluster Utility is an ongoing project which seeks to develop a interface for creating and managing a Debian Beowulf cluster. By using a publicly distributed ledger (also known as a blockchain) to record hardware analytic such as CPU usage and waste heat production, Eusocial Cluster Utility seeks to provide a secure method for ensuring the integrity of data which may later be used to optimize a cluster. As the primary objective of Eusocial Cluster Utility is to provide developers with a distributed platform for performing computationally expensive tasks, Eusocial-Cluster-Utility-0.9.3 comes bundled with a natural language processing bench mark test which uses the spaCy GPU software library for CUDA 10.0 in conjunction with the MediaWiki API. Eusocial Cluster Utility was originally developed by students at Texas Tech University in 2019 and is an on going open source project.

This utility has been developed and proven to work on Ubuntu 18.04 and requires the following dependencies: 

**Python 3.7** – which may be installed via the commands:
```
sudo apt-get install python3.7-dev
sudo apt install python3.7-minimal
```

**psutil** – which may be installed specifically for python3.7 via the command:
```
python3.7 -m pip install psutil
```
**tkinter** – which does not come standard for python3 on Ubuntu 18.04 and may be installed via the command:
```
sudo apt-get install python-tk python3-tk tk-dev
```
To run simply download Eusocial-Cluster-Utility, extract the master directory, navigate into Eusocial-Cluster-Utility-master, and run the command:
```
python3 main.py
```
Eusocial-Cluster-Utility includes a graphic uster interface which will guide you through the creation of your cluster.
